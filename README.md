# dyDNS
dyDNS is a PyPI package for periodically activating dynamicDNS in freedns.afraid.org.

Important information such as username, password and domain name should be encrypted 
with free dynamic DNS providers.

You need to have an account on freedns.afraid.org and choose dynamic domain names:
https://freedns.afraid.org/

You can have up to five domain names for free dynamic DNS.

dyDNS does not need superuser privilege.

# How to prepare for dyDNS
To use this PyPI dyDNS, you need to prepare for .freedns directory and two files: crypted and key.
<pre>
1.You must create .freedns directory in your home directory.
$ cd
$ mkdir .freedns
$ cd .freedns
2.In .freedns directory, you should create a plain authenticiation file: freedns.info.
freedns.info file has three lines (username, password, dynamic domain name).
$ cat freedns.info
USERNAME = "username_freedns.afraid.org"
PASSWORD = "password_freedns.afraid.org"
UPDATE_DOMAINS = ["your_domain_name", ] 
3. Create a plain file of encryption/decryption key for openssl.
key file must contain a string or strings with any characters.
$ cat key
your_key 
4. Change to the key file that only you can read.
$ chmod 700 key
5. Encrypt freedns.info to crypted file
$ openssl enc -e -aes256 -pbkdf2 -in freedns.info -out crypted -k `cat key` 
6. Delete freedns.info file.
$ rm freedns.info
7. ".freedns" directory has two files: crypted and key
$ ls
crypted key
